# Hey there! 

My name is **Vincent Mayer**, originary from Quebec, Canada and actually living in Valdivia, Chile. After travelling the whole American continent, I started studying Web Development and here I am! Recently graduated from the "Universidad del Desarrollo" (Chile), I started my career as a Freelancer and I'm always looking to contribute on all kinds of projects because I know this is the way to keep learning.

## My Productions

In this profil, you'll find diferent types of projects from landing pages to complete e-commerces. Take a look at my learning process as you can find my very first [web page](aromedivine-aceiteesencial.netlify.app/index.html), a basic HTML and CSS web application, as well as my [final project](psicologialosrios.netlify.app/), a complete React.js E-commerce with express.js back-end. There may be a couple more projects you'll find in there, feel free to explore my coding practises and I'll be happy to read your feedback!

## My knowledge

As I am still pretty new in this, I don't consider myself as an expert even if I know quite a few things. For languages, I learned about **HTML 5**, **CSS 3** and **Java Script**, as for the platform, I use **Node.js**. The Front-End frameworks and libraries I know for now are **Tailwind** and **Bootstrap** for styling and **React.js** with **Next.js** for programming. For the Back-End part, I know about **Firebase**, **Express.js** as framework and **MongoDB** for the Data Base. Of course, my projects management are made with **Github**. This may be little for now, but I'll first want to get a good knowledge and practise with the basic before getting in more complex stuff. That doesn't mean I'm not interested, but a little learning is a dangerous thing!
